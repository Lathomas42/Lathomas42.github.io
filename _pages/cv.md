Education
======
* In pursuit of Ph.D in Biophysics, Theunissen Lab, UC Berkeley, entered 2019
* B.S. in Math/Physics, Northeastern University, 2015

Work experience
======
* Software Engineer, Lee Lab, Harvard Medical School, Sept 2017 - Jun 2019
  * Studying Cerebellum Network structure with large scale electron microscopy
    * Lead a project studying network structure of a serial section electron microscopy dataset of mouse cerebellum cerebellum
    * Studied the connection properties of Mossy Fibers and Granule cells using statistical and network modeling to determine if there was any added redundancy to the signal
    * Studied distribution of synaptic weights from mossy fibers to their afferents
    * Oversaw the collection of an additional cerebellum data set ( 1100 .75mm * .75 mm x 40 nm slices ) using temca-gt automated transmission electron microscopy system
  * Worked with collaborators to implement and improve machine learning pipelines for automated fine-alignment and neuronal segmentation of 4nm x 4nm x 40nm voxel size images of neural tissue
  * Xray Imaging, reconstruction, and automated segmentation of neural circuits
    * Collaborated with a lab on the ESRF beamline in France to generate high resolution tomographic reconstructions of various neural tissue from 40 to 100 nm pixel resolution
    * Trained and deployed neural networks for automated segmentation of the xray images
    * Employed transfer learning to accelerate training of neural networks with segmentation data from TEM
  * Improved and maintained a pipeline for large scale alignment of serial section electron microscopy images.
  * Created a pipeline for automated segmentation of electron microscopy and high resolution tomography data using cutting edge U-Net based segmentation networks.
  * Managed undergraduate research assistants in order to assist in the acquisition, alignment and analysis of data
* Software Engineer, Cakewalk, Boston, MA 2015-2017
  * Developed, maintained, and designed cutting edge audio editing software on iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows using C++.
  * Designed and built cross platform Linear Phase Equalizer and Multi-band Compressor Audio Plugins.
  * Collaborating with one other engineer, designed and implemented a complex algorithm which allows the parallel processing of real time Audio Effects (Patent Pending)
  * Designed and built a cross platform high performance Audio Engine capable of streaming and recording multiple concurrent sample rate audio files on iOS, Android, Mac, And Windows
* Undergraduate Researcher, Reid Lab, Harvard Medical School, 2013-2015
  * Annotated and analyzed neuronal connectivity using large-scale electron microscopy
  * Preformed Graph theory (Spectral Clustering Methods) and statistical analysis on data generated from electron microscope images to determine the connectivity patterns of neurons in visual cortex
  * Used Matlab and Python to pull, analyze, and visualize large networks
  * Collaborated with a group to develop a Python module used to pull and analyze data
  * Programmed Arduinos to control various aspects of grid tape inspection/creation
  * Mentored by Dr. Wei Chung Allen Lee
