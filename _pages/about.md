I come from Boston, MA, where I did my undergrad in Math / Physics at Northeastern University. From there I was a software engineer doing Digital Signal Processing, building audio software for two years. After that, I was a software engineer in [Wei Chung Leeâ€™s lab](https://www.lee.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical school for two years where I worked on imaging and reconstructing circuits in the mouse cerebellum. I am very interested in studying how the brain performs auditory processing on a circuit level. Now I am a first year graduate student in [Frederic Theunissen's lab at UC Berkeley](http://theunissen.berkeley.edu/) studying the neural correlates of audition in songbirds.
